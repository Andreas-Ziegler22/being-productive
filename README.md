sometimes I'm productive but no commits here I can share some experiences

today I was installing mysql and I was following my tutorial.

➜  ~ sudo nano /etc/paths

than I wrote 

/usr/local/mysql/bin

Everything  done

I wrote mysql --version 

Answer zhs: command not found 

Now I wrote on google the right question and received the right answer 

this guy came on my question I followed the instructions and works perfectly

now I can access mysql with command line

I don't know why but didn't work at all  I'm here from 20:00 till 22:02 and I saw a lot of videos hot to fix the problem when came this across

source zshrc  after typing that Enter and quit iterm when I wrote:
echo $PATH came the whole path including mysql now I can say it works and I can sleep well
